# Front End Assignment

This is your chance to show off your hands on skills to us. You will develop a small app and present it to us. Just make sure that it runs and we can actually use it beforehand.
It should take you no more than a few hours to complete the assignment, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

+ Solution should be responsive
+ Use the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) with the default location set to New York, NY, and allow the user to change the location by zip code
+ Show the "current" conditions for New York:
  + Location (ie. New York, NY, USA)
  + Current weather description (ie. sunny)
  + Current temperature
  + Today's high temperature
  + Today's low temperature
+ Allow the user to toggle more data in the current conditions area:
    + Wind Speed
    + Humidity
    + Pressure
    + Sunrise/Sunset Time
+ Show the 7 Day forecast

When in doubt, just keep an assumptions log and move on. We value working software and decision making skills.

## Requirements

We like React here at Skyward, but feel free to use any framework. Also, make sure your application runs and include instructions in Readme on how to run it! 

## Submission

To complete your homework, please fork this repo and commit your work to your fork. When you are ready for us to look at it, give us access to your fork so we can review and run it.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
